<h2> Discription of my assignment: </h2>
<p> The second assignment was personally my favourite one. We were asked to create 21 of the letter choice we were give. The sentences we chose as a class was, Thats what he she they said. I was given the letter T and so I created 21 different designs using the p5 website. Overall this assignment was a new one for me learning how to use a new website for coding and helped my coding better than before. Although I would say I still definetly need more progress. </p>
