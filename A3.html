<h2> Discription of my assignment: </h2>
<p> We were asked to create an infographic of a topic that we use of a screen in our daily ife. For me perosnally I chose to do a GPS because this is something I always use on my phone. Going out new places is a hobby, I prefer to be out rather than inside, espicially because of being already locked indoors for 2 years, COVID-19, I have been making up for lost time.</p>
